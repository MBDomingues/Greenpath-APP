### 📌 About the Project

**GreenPath** is a native mobile app (Android/iOS) that allows users to calculate, monitor, and take action to reduce their personal carbon footprint. By logging daily activities such as transportation, food, and energy consumption, the app provides clear insights into each user's environmental impact, encouraging more sustainable habits.

Beyond monitoring, the project also aims to strengthen the local and conscious economy by featuring a list of **partner stores and services** that follow sustainable practices, creating a complete ecosystem for a greener life.
